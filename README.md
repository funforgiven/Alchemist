# Alchemist
- School project made for our CMP3999 Mini Project class in Bahcesehir University.
- It is made in Unity using C# as the scripting language.

## Key points
- Alchemist includes a procedural generation algorithm consisting of connected rooms and corridors with modifiable parameters to customize the generation.
- Alchemist includes a custom behaviour tree for the enemy intelligence.

## Why there are so few commits
We used PlasticSCM as version control because it works really well with Unity and handles large binary files better than git without the need for something like LFS. Then, we uploaded the project's final form to the GitHub to make it accessible for everyone.
